                    <br>
                    <p>Python is my best-known programming language. I have knowledge and professional experience in areas of data <u>scraping</u>,
                        data <u>processing</u>, data <u>visualization</u> and <u>automation apps development</u>. Below technologies are my strongest points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pandas/NumPy</li>
                        <li>Selenium, BeautifulSoup4</li>
                        <li>Matplotlib</li>
                        <li>TkInter GUI</li>
                        <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>

                    <br>
                    <p>Except data processing, I am constantly developing myself in term of full-stack development.
                            I have basic knowledge about <b>Django</b>, acquired during interactive courses on platforms like Udemy.com and Pluralsight.com.</p>
                    <p>My Python knowledge that can be used as a backend is also supported by basic knowledge of <b>HTML</b>, <b>Bootstrap 3 and 4</b>,
                    <b>CSS</b> and <b>Javascript/JQuery</b> fundamentals.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">SQL, Jupyter, Linux</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have some experience with SQL queries - especially in SQLite3 Python's library. I can use Jupyter Notebook efficiently in case of Python coding. Linux is also convenient to work for me, as I use it in my private programming practices.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I would like to continue my self-development in terms of Django framework and frontend staff, which would help me to become proficient full-stack developer.
                    I am also focused on expanding my skills in SQL and in things related with cloud servers support.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>'pyBreak' is a project created in goal to show my Python skills in areas of web scraping,
                        data processing and analysis with properly prepared dataset. It's strictly connected with my hobbies
                        - tennis is one of my favourite sports, which has many interesting aspects that are the subject of my data analysis.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Project presents the work performed in case of scraping two different data sources with help of Selenium library.
                    Then, scraped data is being processed in Pandas. Both technologies are well-known for me due to my daily professional job.
                    Further steps regarding the choice of specific dataset's parts for particular data analysis requires the ability to perform proper
                        SQL queries (SQLite3 in this case), which results are shown by
                    data visualization in popular Matplotlib.</p>

                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data comes from two different sources, which are needed to be parsed and standarized.</li>
                        <li>Standarization is needed due to different approach of presenting date formats, player's naming and matches scores' patterns.</li>
                        <li>Data should be processed in the way which allows to merge both sources into one project's base dataframe.</li>
                        <li>SQL and visualization skills are helpful to present interesting content behind the data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>
                    <p>Plans for the future relate to present the results of pyBreak backend job (which is done) in form of interactive dashboards
                    here in the Django web application. Work is in progress.</p>
